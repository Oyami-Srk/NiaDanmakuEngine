#1.What Is NIA?
Nia is just Nia. In Chinese, I want it to be called *妮娅*(Like a lovely girl's name?).

This is obsolete, right? All because of my stupid......

By the way, Nia can also be considered as the abbreviation of "Not In Action".

Maybe this is the best answer to what NIA is......

#2.What does the Nia do?
Nothing but a game engine!
